To Do: 

Add Remove All Functionality (Ian)
Finish analytics (John)
Desktop styling for search + icons (Elifaz)
Practicing Speech (Amol);
Implement spinner


EXPANDED SEARCH: 
  confirm logic of optimization for Expanded Search
  don't drop pin if no improved option
  Improve UX for when optimal ride matches intial result (just say no reduced surge pricing in search area)


CLEANUP: 
remove Optimal Time + logic for ALL files
remove console logs
remove commented code


Presentation: 
  Aaron (revise final paragraph and improve delivery)
  Let DriveUs drive you







IN PROGRESS: 
  - draw circle on map
  X - do not display "Better Deals" until we detect a surge
  X - Button Bar to determine distance willing to walk (incorporate walk time +/- eta)
  X - compare based on surge multiplier, not based on time or price 
  X - capture slider input when searching

GENERAL NOTES: 

  - Fix error message throwing (try, catch, )
  - Fix commit messages (agree to style guides)
  - Click to expand additional product lines (besides top 3) - force same sizing
  - Google auth?

TO Do: 
  write tests (invalid GPS coordinates, no results, timeouts, etc)

Back burner: 
  look into improving promise workflow

DONE: 
  X - initiate comparison cheaper/faster w/ initial location (if equally cheap/fast, but more fast/cheap)
  X - actually getting cheapest
  X - actually getting fastest (without walking directions)
  X - comment code
  X - Migrate to ES6;
  X - Add Check if best Price AND Time (if so, perhaps show different icon?)
  X - Look into excluding carpooling options from Optimal Time calc b/c unreliable
  X - write ReadMe and clean up docs on github
  X - walking directions (google API) https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro
  X - include Walking Directions and Time from origin to destination
  X - Show Surge Multiplier
  X - investigate writing results to DB
  X - get from computer to mobile (text from twilio)
  X - style buttons/background
  X - draw circle on map corresponding to radius size
  X - wipe away previous expanded searches
  X - fix buttons
